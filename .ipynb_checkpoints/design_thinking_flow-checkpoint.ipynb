    "In this stage time is dedicated to understanding the business opportunities.\n",

    "In this setting the frequency and duration of customer visits are going to be related to overall sales. The initial business opportunity here is: How do you ensure new games drive revenue? There are many other business opportunities, like what is the optimal menu for the customer-base and do seasonal variations of offerings help the business? For now,  let's focus on ensuring that new games drive revenue for this example.\n",
    " \n",
    "As part of this stage you would talk with your friend, her employees and some customers to do your best to fully understand the experience of the customer. The important thing here is to spend time on-site simulating the experience of a customer to obtain as genuine an understanding of the problem as possible. You may realize that most customers are there to work or most of them are just passing through. This domain knowledge is useful when making decisions like which new types of new games to create.\n",
    " \n",
    " After you have gathered your information and studied it you will generally articulate the business scenario using a scientific thought process—this means a statement that can be tested. The business opportunity should be stated in a way that minimizes the presence of confounding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are logical follow-up questions to ask to fully understand the problem, but the next two stages are the more appropriate places to get into these details. Now that you understand the problem it is time to gather the data.\n",

    "HINT:  This is the stage where we gather all of the data and we make note of what would be ideal data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data here are mostly sales and customer profiles. There are two important aspects of the data that would be ideal:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are at a transaction level (each purchase and its associated data are recorded)\n",
    "We can associate game usage with transactions.\n",
    "Fortunately for us this is a modern cafe so customers order and play games through the same interface. Additionally, they are incentivized to login to the system and generate a customer profile. In this stage we go through the process of gathering the raw data. This may involve querying a database, gathering files, web-scraping and other mechanisms. It is important to gather all of the relevant data in this stage, because access and quality of the data may force you to modify the business question. It is very difficult to assess the quality of data when it is not in hand. If possible, efforts should be made to collect even marginally related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets assume that your initial investigation led you to understand that games that used quotations from the books in an interactive way were the most effective. So you have come up with the idea to develop a game that is built on a chatbot that has been trained to talk like Sherlock. This would involve Natural Language Processing (NLP) and we would need a corpus of textual data. As a start you might download The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle from Project Gutenberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT:  This is a live coding example and we suggest that you open a Jupyter notebook either locally or within Watson Studio so that you may annotate and expand on the example freely."
