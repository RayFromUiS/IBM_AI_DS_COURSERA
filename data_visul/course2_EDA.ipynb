To get some answers they might learn about the cast, the crew, the reviews. It turns out review website Rotten Tomatoes has already done much of this EDA for you. It provides summary statistics, production shots and a link to the trailer. It goes without saying that these visuals will factor heavily into how you perceive the yet unseen film."

    "Data scientists are largely familiar with EDA, its benefits and its place in the overall AI workflow, but this is one part of the workflow that will always have room for improvement. Data visualization and results communication are both analogous to downhill skiing—in just a few tries you can obtain the minimum level of proficiency, but it takes many years to become an expert. One challenge on the road to proficiency is the many options in how data can be visualized and similarly how results can be communicated. The general procedure for EDA has several aspects that are consistent despite the variation.  "
